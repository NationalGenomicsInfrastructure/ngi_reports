# General Information

The results apply to the sample(s) as received.

## Samples and/or libraries that have failed RC (Reception control) and/or Lib. QC (Library quality control)

In cases where samples and/or libraries have failed the QC, the user is always consulted regarding how to proceed. If the user wishes to proceed to sequence the failed samples and/or libraries, NGI bears no responsibility regarding the quality and number of reads of the sequenced sample data.

{% if not project.skip_fastq -%}
## Naming conventions

The data is delivered in FastQ format using Illumina 1.8 quality scores.
There will be one file for the forward reads and one file for the
reverse reads (if the run was a paired-end run).

The naming of the files follow the convention:

```
[NGI-NAME]_[BCL-CONVERSION-ID]_[LANE]_[READ]_[VOLUME].fastq.gz
```

* _NGI-NAME:_ Internal NGI sample identifier
* _BCL-CONVERSION-ID:_ Identifier set by bcl2fastq tool while demultiplexing
* _LANE:_ Sequencing lane that the file originates from
* _READ:_ Forward(1) or reverse(2) read identifier
* _VOLUME:_ Volume index when file is large enough to be split into volumes

## Data access at DDS

Data have been uploaded to the **Data Delivery System**
(DDS, [https://delivery.scilifelab.se](https://delivery.scilifelab.se)).
